This is my first project since I started to learn CSS, HTML and JAVASCRIPT (I've been learning for 3 months). The goal is to show my skills on these tools, recreating the SpaceX website homepage with some new interactions, like the ROCKETS SHOP and LOGIN SCREEN, using some concepts like: 

  - Objects and DOM manipulation;
  - Map, filter, join, sort and addEventListener;
  - Loops;
  - Modulation (import, export);
  - Responsive Layout, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS;
  - Trying to Best Practices and Refactoring.

## Tools
  - Javascript;
  - CSS;
  - HTML;
  - Photoshop CC;
  - Adobe XD;
  - Whimsical (to create flowcharts for code logic);
  - Git.
